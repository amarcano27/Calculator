# Python Calculator Program

This is a command-line calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program includes user-friendly prompts and error handling.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles division by zero with appropriate error messages.
- Allows users to:
  - Continue calculations with the current result.
  - Start a new calculation.
  - Exit the program.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer.
2. Install the required `art` library for ASCII art:
   ```bash
   pip install art
3. Copy and paste the provided code into a file named calculator.py.

Usage
  Run the program by executing:                                                                                                                                                                                                                       python calculator.py
Follow the prompts:
  Enter the first number.
  Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
  Enter the next number.
  View the result.
After each calculation, you can:
  Continue calculating with the current result.
  Start a new calculation.
  Exit the program.

Error Handling
  Invalid Input: If you enter non-numeric input, the program will ask you to try again.
  Division by Zero: If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an error message and let you retry.
